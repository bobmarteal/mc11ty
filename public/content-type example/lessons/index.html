    An all-road bicycle that could handle a daily commute in rain-soaked upstate
    New York and spend hours on gravel roads of my new home in Richmond.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>
  This bicycle is called Lessons. I thought of the name the thirteenth time or
  so I walked into my kitchen, sighed deeply, then optimistically said, "Well I
  learned another valuable lesson." Perhaps the biggest lesson building this
  bicycle has taught me is gratitude in the opportunity to pursue this crazy
  dream. I have fallen so in love with this process that each misstep along the
  way didn't lead to frustration, but a lesson of how to improve and learn. For
  the first time in a heap of years, I'm creating something that I can hold,
  understand, and be proud of.

<h2>Design brief</h2>
<p>
  The design brief for Lessons was for an all-road bicycle to handle a daily
  commute in rain-soaked upstate New York and spend hours on gravel roads in
  comfort and style. The bicycle can be mounted with a rear rack for paniers and
  full-length fenders. Tire clearance is a robust 700x47. Flat-mount brakes and
  thru-axles embrace current standards and provide safe, powerful braking and a
  stiff feel.

<h2>Build out details</h2>
<p>
  The Columbus Futura Cross carbon fork keeps the front end light and stable.
  The 1x SRAM Rival drivetrain and groupset perfectly match the riding goals for
  the bicycle. The Hunt 4-season disc wheels shod with 700x42 Teravail Ramparts
  are set up tubeless and are fast and supple. Up front the 46mm Salsa
  Cowchipper provides comfort and stability in all terrain.
