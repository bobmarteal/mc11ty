<h2>Erin Marteal, CEO</h2>
<figure class="right"> <img src="/images/erin-marteal.jpg" alt="Erin Marteal"/><figcaption>Erin Marteal, CEO</figcaption></figure>
<p>As executive director of Ithaca Children's Garden (2011-22) Erin (she/her) led a transformational organizational change with rippling community impact. Over the course of a decade, she led the growth of the staff team from 1 to 10, the board of directors from 3 to 11, annual visitation from 9,000 to 70,000+, weathered the pandemic establishing new contracts to deepen mission impact, and grew the annual operating budget from $40,000 to $530,000. Erin retired $60,000 of inherited debt within the first 2 years and stepped down after 10 years with 3 months of operating reserves in the bank, a well-respected world-class brand with numerous strategic partnerships, and awards earned by ICG's solid reputation in the community and nationally.
</p>







<p>Erin's expertise ranges from board development, team engagement, increasing representation, collaborative processes, and fund development, to problem solving through innovation, strategic planning for structure and flexibility, and community alliance-building for impact.</p>


<h3>A mission-driven empathetic ally</h3>
<p>Leveraging more than a decade of transformative nonprofit leadership as executive director, along with board service and collaborative leadership experience with a consortium of 100 fellow executive directors, Erin's desire to see nonprofits reach their goals in service to a better world is central to her personal and professional purpose. Her passion is to facilitate the effective work of nonprofit leaders with presence, joy, and impact. She collaborates with executives and organizational leadership teams to do their best, be their best and love their work.</p>

<h2>
    Making your big vision real
</h2>
<p>
    Our respect for the demands of nonprofit work- and the unicorns who carry out the work - runs deep. Your specific needs inform how we tailor our approach to best support your organizational progress. Our goal is that you walk away from our engagement with practical tools you can confidently implement, new strategies for working through obstacles, and refreshed energy to make your BIG vision real.
</p>
<h2>The nuts and bolts</h2>
<h3>Are you ready? We'd love to hear from you.</h3>
<p>So, you got this far and you want to know what's next.</p>
<p class="step">Step 1</p>
<p> Get in touch by email, text, or phone to share your initial thoughts on what you'd like to work on together. erin@martealconsulting.com, (607) 227-2982</p>
<p class="step">Step 2</p>
<p> We will connect over a complimentary discovery session. This generally lasts 45-60 minutes but could be as quick as 30 or take up to 75, depending on your unique situation and needs. You'll share more about your situation and I will probe for understanding. My aim here is to assess whether I am a fit for your needs. You will also be getting to know me and assessing fit.</p>
<p>
If I have any concerns about my ability to help you meet your goals, I will share those proactively and transparently. If I think you would be served best by a different service or resource, I will point you that way. If we need another call with an additional member of the team to discuss further, we can arrange that too. Taking time up front to clarify expectations is always a good use of time (our most valuable resource!).</p>
<p class="step">Step 3</p>
<p> How we move forward will be tailored to your needs, goals, timeline, and budget. You may already know what format would be most helpful to you. I will also have ideas for how to best structure our engagement to best meet your goals. I will clarify our engagement plan in writing to establish clear expectations. We will discuss, tweak as necessary, sign to indicate we are on the same page, and be off and running! </p>
