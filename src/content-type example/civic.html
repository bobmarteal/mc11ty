introduction: This is the Civic. It was built for my son, who does in-fact, have a wild infatuation with the Honda Civic. This bicycle represents the first frame built by me, without the watchful eye of a master frame builder and teacher. I thought my first bike Lessons was aptly named, but being able to “create your own learning opportunities” is a different experience in the humbling nature of bicycle frame building.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>
  This is the Civic. It was built for my son, who does in-fact, have a wild
  infatuation with the Honda Civic. This bicycle represents the first frame
  built by me, without the watchful eye of a master frame builder and teacher. I
  thought my first bike Lessons was aptly named, but being able to “create your
  own learning opportunities” is a different experience in the humbling nature
  of bicycle frame building.
</p>
<h2>Design brief</h2>
<p>
  The idea for the bicycle was to create a road specific frame that will be a
  good learning platform for me, and something that will have room for upgrades
  for him in the future. There was no desire for fenders, but I insisted on the
  option for a rack. The client was insistent on 25mm tires, but we built it out
  to comfortably take 28mm road tires. The fit is the cool unique part of this
  frame. The rider is 6-3, and all torso and arms. He specifically wanted a long
  reach and to be high above the crank.
</p>
<h2>Build out details</h2>
<p>
  The build out on this bicycle focused on the best quality on a modest budget.
  We went with SRAM Apex drive-train and levers. They work great and any part of
  is easily upgradable as money and ambition become available. TRP Spyre brakes
  offer great stopping power, and easy maintenance. The wheels are Prime
  Stagiaire disc. The one big splurge was the Hutchinson Fusion 5 tires.

  *Another great thing about this project is sharing the creative experience
  with my son who did all the photography and image production.
