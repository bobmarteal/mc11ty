<h2 id="executive-support">Executive Support</h2>
<p>
Nonprofit leaders face challenges vast and varied every day, often before breakfast. Pulling in support at the right time can make the difference between progressing towards identified goals and tapering morale.
</p>
<p>If you are facing an organizational or leadership transition, need new ideas to make your big vision a reality, or help sorting your priorities so you don’t take your work home at night, working with an experienced nonprofit leader - outside of your organization - can help.</p>

<h3>What does executive support look like?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A safe, supportive sounding board for your team's most influential asset</li>
    <li>A “tool” in your executive director's backpocket; i.e. insight available on demand</li>
    <li>Time tested approach to working successfully with a board</li>
    <li>Tips and strategies for leading staff</li>
    <li>“When I can't talk to my staff and I'm not ready to talk to the board”
    </li>
    <li>A buffer against functional isolation in decision-making
    </li>
    <li>Priority clarification
    </li>
    <li>Turning a plan into action
    </li>
    <li>Supportive accountability buddy
    </li>
    <li>Strategies for troubleshooting tricky team dynamics</li>
    <li>Trust building across differences</li>
    <li>Establishing a culture of giving and receiving effective feedback</li>
    <li>Norm checking for health-promotive, functional behaviors 
    </li>
    <li>Training in the elusive art of delegation
    </li>
    <li>Tactical tips from managing team communications to calendars
    </li>

    </li>
