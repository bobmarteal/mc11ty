<p>
In 2011, I stepped into a role as executive director of a very small startup nonprofit in upstate New York that had been through an extended period of challenging times, including a four year period with no director. I came into this role with a background in garden-based learning and virtually no nonprofit experience. </p>
<p><img src="/images/erin-marteal.jpg" alt="Erin Marteal" class="right"/>What I lacked in direct experience I made up for in heart, excessive numbers of hours off the clock, and an array of what had previously seemed like unrelated work experience. As executive director, I clearly saw every life and work experience I had had up to that point pressed into service- from waiting tables (keeping everyone's orders in my head until I could get back to the computer to enter them, even if I was interrupted seven times with special requests on the way, and delivering what was requested with a smile, making things right with the customer when the kitchen was backed up, etc.) to cleaning houses, (yes the executive director of a small nonprofit will be scrubbing the toilet, wiping the sink, taking out the trash, and painting the walls multiple coats in an effort to eradicate the insidious smoke smell from the previous tenants to convey to her growing team that they are valued and deserve a respectable work environment even if the roof does leak from time to time) to working as a home health aide in an assisted living facility, packing herbs, delivering newspapers, other professional roles, and of course parenting  (being all things to all people all the time with no sleep and no self care). Suffice it to say that while all of these experienced

<h3>Experience to expand your bench</h3>
<p>Over the course of a decade, I led the growth of our staff team from 1 to 10, our board of directors from 3 to 11, our annual visitation from 9,000 to 70,000+, weathered the pandemic establishing new contracts and relationships to deepen our impact, and grew our annual operating budget from $40,000 to $530,000. I retired $60,000 of inherited debt within the first 3 years and stepped down after 10 years with 3 months of operating reserves in the bank and numerous awards earned by our solid standing in the community and across the nation.</p>

<h3>It's all about the Presence, Joy, & Impact</h3>
<p>While my expertise ranges from board development, team engagement, collaborative processes, fund development, and organizational sustainability to problem solving through innovation, strategic planning for structure and flexibility, and community alliance-building for impact, my passion is to facilitate nonprofit movement towards clear goals with presence,  joy, and impact. </p>

<h3>A mission-driven empathetic ally</h3>
<p>Leveraging more than a decade of transformative nonprofit leadership as an executive director (2011-2022) , additional board service and collaborative leadership experience serving alongside fellow executive directors to develop our respective leadership and toolboxes, my desire to see nonprofits reach their goals in service to a better world runs deep. I collaborate with executives and organizational leadership teams to do their best, be their best and love their work so the communities they touch can be better, and so too can be, the world.
But that does not happen if nonprofit leaders are overwhelmed and burnt out. It doesn't happen if executives are unsupported and left to go it alone. It take the whole wide village to ensure that nonprofits have the resources they need to do their best work and make the most meaningful impact possible in the time they have available. This includes taking care of their most important asset - their people. </p>

<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>My respect for the demands of nonprofit work- and the unicorns who carry out the work - runs deep. Your specific needs inform how I tailor my highly individualized approach to best support your organizational progress. My goal is that you walk away from our engagement with practical tools that you can confidently implement, new strategies for approaching and working through obstacles, refreshed energy and purpose, and a hum in your heart with a chorus line to the tune,, “dang! I got my money's worth and then some, dang, I got my moneys worth and then some, I got my money's worth and then some, …”  whether this tune resonates with you just yet or not is unimportant. What is important is that you come open and ready for positive movement towards achieving your goals because that's exactly what we'll do! </p>
