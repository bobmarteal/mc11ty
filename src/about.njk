<h2>About Erin Marteal</h2>

<p>
In 2011, I stepped into a role as executive director of a very small startup nonprofit in upstate New York that had been through an extended period of challenging times, including a four year period with no director. I came into this role with a background in garden-based learning and virtually no nonprofit experience. </p>
<p><figure class="right"><img src="/images/erin-marteal.jpg" alt="Erin Marteal"/><figcaption>Erin Marteal, CEO</figcaption></figure>What I lacked in direct experience I made up for in heart, excessive numbers of hours off the clock, and an array of what had previously seemed like unrelated work experience. In my new role, I saw every life and work experience pressed into service. </p><p>Those summers waiting tables trained me to hear, track and deliver upon the requests and needs of those I was serving, while navigating emotional and organizational ebbs and flows. Cleaning houses hardened me off to “other tasks as necessary” that fall to you when you are the buck's last stop (what does that even mean?). Experience as a homeowner, and property manager gave me unlikely skills from covering smoke-infused walls in your new office with 3 coats of paint, to knowing what questions to ask while designing a multi-million dollar building.</p><p> Through all of these experiences I learned to pay attention to important details unfolding in real time while keeping an eye on the horizon. It didn't take long to learn that I could not realize my  aspirations for the organization alone, though try as I might (I never had been good at asking for help).  I needed a lot of help. And so began the challenge of building a team of empowered unicorns.
</p>
<p> I also understood that our team would need to be well cared for if they were to be tasked with caring for the community. </p>
<p> Where I saw other nonprofits lament scarcity of board talent and sought “anyone who was willing,” I committed to inviting only the best talent that would advance ICG's mission in alignment with the values I wanted to manifest towards the vision of making the world more beautiful, resilient, and just and helping them be and feel supported and be prepared for their work at hand.</p>


<h2>Marteal Consulting, LLC</h2>
<h3>Experience to expand your bench</h3>
<p>Over the course of a decade, I led the growth of our staff team from 1 to 10, our board of directors from 3 to 11, our annual visitation from 9,000 to 70,000+, weathered the pandemic establishing new contracts to deepen our impact, and grew our annual operating budget from $40,000 to $530,000. I retired $60,000 of inherited debt within the first 3 years and stepped down after 10 years with 3 months of operating reserves in the bank and numerous awards earned by our solid standing in the community and across the nation.</p>

<h3>Presence, Joy, & Impact</h3>
<p>Marteal Consulting's expertise ranges from board development, team engagement, increasing representation, collaborative processes, and fund development,to problem solving through innovation, strategic planning for structure and flexibility, and community alliance-building for impact. My passion is to facilitate the effective work of nonprofit leaders, and nonprofit progress with presence, joy, and impact.</p>

<h3>A mission-driven empathetic ally</h3>
<p>Leveraging more than a decade of transformative nonprofit leadership as an executive director (2011-2022) along with board service and collaborative leadership experience with a consortium of 100 fellow executive directors, my desire to see nonprofits reach their goals in service to a better world is central to my personal and professional purpose. I collaborate with executives and organizational leadership teams to do their best, be their best and love their work so the communities they touch can be better, and so too by extension, can be the world. </p>
<p>Of course that's a lot less likely to happen if nonprofit leaders are overwhelmed, burnt out, or feeling unsupported. It takes the whole dang village to ensure that nonprofits have the resources they need to do their best work and make the most meaningful impact possible in the time they have available (no, this is not 24/7). This includes taking care of their most important assets - their own well-being, and that of their people.</p>

<h2>Our Approach</h2>
<p>My respect for the demands of nonprofit work- and the unicorns who carry out the work - runs deep. With that basis, your specific needs inform how I tailor my individualized approach to best support your organizational progress. My goal is that you walk away from our engagement with practical tools you can confidently implement, new strategies for working through obstacles, refreshed energy and purpose, and a hum in your heart with a chorus line to the tune,, “dang! I got my money's worth and then some, dang, I got my money's worth and then some, I got my money's worth and then some, …” Whether this tune resonates with you just yet is unimportant. What is important is that you come open to positive movement towards achieving your goals, because that's exactly what we'll do!</p>

<h3>The nuts and bolts</h3>
<p>So, you got this far and you want to know what's next.</p>


<p>STEP 1. Use this form to share your thoughts on what you'd like to work on together.</p>

<p>STEP 2. We will have a complimentary consultation. This will generally last 45-60 minutes but could be as quick as 30 or take up to 75, depending on your unique situation and needs. You'll share your situation and I will probe for understanding. My aim here is to assess whether I am a fit for your needs and goals. You will also be getting to know me and assessing fit.</p>
<p>STEP 3. If I have any doubt in my ability to help you meet your goals, I will share my concerns proactively and transparently. If I think you would be served best by a different service or resource, I will point you that way. If we need another call with an additional member of the team to discuss further, we can arrange that too. Taking time up front to clarify expections is always a good use of time (our most valuable resource!). </p>
<p>STEP 4. How we move forward will be tailored to your needs, goals, timeline, and budget. At this point, we will work together to draft a framework for our engagement. 
You may already know what format would be most helpful to you. I will also have ideas for how to best structure our engagement for your organizational goals.

<h2>A note about where in the world I work.</h2>
 <p>I perform the majority of my work remotely from my Richmond-based office in Scott's Addition (VentureX). I also have roots in Northern Virginia (Alexandria) and upstate New York (Ithaca), and regularly travel to both, making it feasible to weave in in-person visits at no or nominal cost, depending on timing. I am also delighted to travel to wherever in the world you work, if that's in your budget. If you are based in Hawaii, Fiji, or another tropical location, let's talk about trade potential ;)</p>
