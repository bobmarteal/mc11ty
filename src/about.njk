    Making your big vision real

<h2>The nuts and bolts</h2>
<h3>Are you ready? We'd love to hear from you.</h3>
<p>So, you got this far and you want to know what's next.</p>
<p class="step">Step 1</p>
<p> Get in touch by email, text, or phone to share your initial thoughts on what you'd like to work on together. erin@martealconsulting.com, (607) 227-2982</p>
<p class="step">Step 2</p>
<p> We will connect over a complimentary discovery session. This generally lasts 45-60 minutes but could be as quick as 30 or take up to 75, depending on your unique situation and needs. You'll share more about your situation and I will probe for understanding. My aim here is to assess whether I am a fit for your needs. You will also be getting to know me and assessing fit.</p>
<p>
If I have any concerns about my ability to help you meet your goals, I will share those proactively and transparently. If I think you would be served best by a different service or resource, I will point you that way. If we need another call with an additional member of the team to discuss further, we can arrange that too. Taking time up front to clarify expectations is always a good use of time (our most valuable resource!).</p>
<p class="step">Step 3</p>
<p> How we move forward will be tailored to your needs, goals, timeline, and budget. You may already know what format would be most helpful to you. I will also have ideas for how to best structure our engagement to best meet your goals. I will clarify our engagement plan in writing to establish clear expectations. We will discuss, tweak as necessary, sign to indicate we are on the same page, and be off and running! </p>

<h2>A note about where in the world I work.</h2>
 <p>I perform the majority of my work remotely from my Richmond-based office in Scott's Addition (VentureX). I also have roots in Northern Virginia (Alexandria) and upstate New York (Ithaca), and regularly travel to both, making it feasible to weave in in-person visits at no or nominal cost, depending on timing. I am also delighted to travel to wherever in the world you work, if that's in your budget. If you are based in Hawaii, Fiji, or another tropical location, let's talk about trade potential ;)</p>
